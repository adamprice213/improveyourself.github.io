			<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Synthesis Activity 1: Discuss the view that ‘From 1931 it was inevitable that Spain would experience a civil war.</strong></h3>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Thesis:</span><span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">The view that ‘From 1931 it was inevitable that Spain would experience a civil war,’ can be argued to be true through the rise of the Popular Front, the conflicts that arose during the argriculture vs industrial dispute, and the general strikes, despite the unity brought about from the church and the army.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Assertion 1:</span> <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">To begin, the rise of the Popular Front in the mid-1930s had supported the inevitability of a Spanish Civil War even though most parties did not support violence.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Assertion 2:</span> <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">Similarly, the dispute between an agriculture or industrial economy had led to a disagreement in a large majority of workers, emphasizing how a Civil War was inevitable, despite the land reforms for agriculture.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Assertion 3:</span> <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">In addition to the rise of the Popular Front and the economic dispute, the general strikes that arose on a multidud of occassions overshadowed the successes of the Second Republic, leading to an inevitable Spanish Civil War.</span></p>

			<ol>
  <li><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">May 17, 1902 (4)</span> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">Alfonso XIII is crowned king of Spain - Crowning Alfonso XIII as King is partly significant as a cause of the Spanish Civil War as his inexperience and the failure to rule over the economy, politics, military, and the general public had caused major issues for Spain. However, his acts of unexperience could have been flipped with the reign of a new King.</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Aug 9, 1921 (3)</span> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">Spanish Army loss of Annual in Morocco. - This had led to the Spanish Civil War in that it had encouraged militant ideology throughout Spain.</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">1925 (2)</span> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">Repealing the self-government that the separatists have developed - This angered the left wing of Spain, which increased political tensions and led to a rise in the Popular Front (right wing)</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">April 1931 (6)</span> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">Spain becoming a Republic - Ranked over the the Popular Front due to its importance being higher due to its demonstration of the tendency for Spain’s government system to change which shows how the government is unstable.</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Oct. 1931 (3)</span> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">Repression of power of Spanish Roman Catholic Church through Article 26 - This is not very important as it only caused controversy among members of the church, and the church didn’t do anything about it, and those rights were eventually restored.</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">October 29, 1933 (5)</span> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">Popular Front established - The Popular Front establishment increased political tensions as the front causes lots of controversy in the Republic.</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Feb 16, 1936 (5)</span> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">Falange Espanola established - The Falange Espanola establishment, equal to Popular Front, increased political tensions as the front causes lots of controversy in the Republic.</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">May 1936 (1)</span> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">CNT conference about revolution - insignificant as war was already inevitable before the conference.</span></li>
  <li><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">Dec. 20, 1973 (7)</span> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">Assassination of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Carrero Blanco - The assassination was a turning point and can be considered the start of the Spanish Civil War, much like the assassination of Archduke Ferdinanz.</span></li>
