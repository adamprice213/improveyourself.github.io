  <li><strong><span style="color: rgb(265,163,1);">Client state</span></strong> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">A state which, more often than not as an end-result of monetary or political help, gives uncritical loyalty to another state. Following the French intrusion of the Iberian Peninsula, Spain excessively was transformed into a client state of Spain under Joseph Bonaparte.</span></li>
  <li><strong><span style="color: rgb(265,163,1);">Caudillo</span></strong> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">Francisco Franco was a Spanish general and lawmaker who managed over Spain as head of state and tyrant under the title Caudillo from 1939, after the Nationalist triumph in the Spanish Civil War, until his passing in 1975. This period in Spanish history is generally known as Francoist Spain or the Francoist autocracy.</span></li>
  <li><strong><span style="color: rgb(265,163,1);">Blue Division</span></strong> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">The Blue Division, was a unit of Spanish volunteers and recruits who served (1941-1944) in the German Army on the Eastern Front during the Second World War. The Blue Division was the main part of the German Army to be granted their very own decoration, authorized by Hitler in January 1944 after the Division had exhibited its adequacy in obstructing the development of the Red Army. Blue Division losses all through the Russo-German clash totaled 22,700. In real life against the Blue Division, the Red Army endured 49,300 setbacks.</span></li>
  <li><strong><span style="color: rgb(265,163,1);">Law of Political Responsibility (1939)</span></strong> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">A law gave by Francoist Spain on 13 February 1939 two months before the finish of the Spanish Civil War. The Law focused on all follower supporters of the Second Spanish Republic and punished participation in the Popular Front of the vanquished republic. The Law of Political Responsibilities, changed in 1942 and in power until 1966, was proclaimed so as to give a lawful spread to the restraint did during the disassembly of the Spanish republican foundations, just as to punish the individuals who had stayed faithful to the legitimately settled government at the hour of the July 1936 military disobedience to the Spanish Republic. It was a focal bit of the Francoist suppression in the after war period and an expected a large portion of a million people were indicted.</span></li>
  <li><strong><span style="color: rgb(265,163,1);">“White Terror”</span></strong> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">the arrangement of deaths that were done by the Nationalist group during the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), and the initial nine years of the system of General Francisco Franco. In the 1936–45 period, Francoist Spain had numerous adversaries of the state: Loyalists to the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39), the Liberals, the Popular Front, and the Socialists, and the rebels, and Freemasons. The cleansing of Leftism from Spain was the political response that was required so as to restore the government instead of the Second Republic. The Francoist Repression was persuaded by the conservative idea of a limpieza social, a purging of society, whereby, the death of adversaries of-the-state started promptly upon the Nationalists' catch of a spot. Ideologically, the Roman Catholic Church legitimized the deaths by the Civil Guard (national police) and the Falange as the barrier of Christendom. </li>
