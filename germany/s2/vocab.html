This ideology was a major method used by Hitler to consolidate power. This thought process is very similar to how Russia’s tsars claimed that it was their god-given right to supremely lead Russia.</span></li>
  <li><strong><span style="color: rgb(265,163,1);">Ubermensch</span></strong> - <span style="color: rgb(51,51,255);">“Super Man” in German.

This perspective was adapted from biological darwinism, which was developed by Charles Darwin, initially intended for assessment of animals.
